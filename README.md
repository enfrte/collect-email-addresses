# collect-email-addresses

This code assignment collects email addresses via form submission, and stores them in a database. 

The path to the form is Assignment\EmailForm\Frontend\index.php 

## Feedback

The assignment wasn't too dificult. I decided to try this in an OO way, which was different to the version I had previously done for the frontend assignment. 

I had to read up on OO PHP and design patterns for a few hours because I have very little experience of OOP outside of MVC frameworks. It then took me a couple of hours to implement the feature. So in total, it took about 5 hours. While researching, I found an example singelton design pattern to connect to the database - https://gist.github.com/jameskropp/eb2b2cc9668a65da0aabc105f8140374 I also modified a basic form validation class I found online. 

All in all, I probably don't know enough about OOP to verify if what I've done is "good practice". In the near future I'll create a new branch to include composer and namespacing.
